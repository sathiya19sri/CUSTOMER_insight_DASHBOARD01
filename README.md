About what I done in this project
 1. What Customer Insights Mean
Definition: Customer insights (also called consumer insights) are data‑driven interpretations of human behavior that reveal motivations, needs, and trends.

Purpose: They bridge the gap between raw data (like sales numbers or survey results) and actionable strategies (like product improvements or marketing campaigns).

Outcome: Businesses use insights to increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sales

2.What my project Is
You are building a relational database system in MySQL with three main tables:

Customers

  Stores customer details like ID, name, and signup date.

  Each customer can place one or more orders.

Orders

  Stores order details like order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.

  Each order belongs to a customer.

  This table connects customers to the products they buy.

Products

  Stores product details like product ID, product name, category, and the order ID it belongs to.

  Each product is linked to an order through a foreign key.
